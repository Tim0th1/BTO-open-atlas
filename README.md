Open Data Science for Ornithology based on the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) Bird Atlas 2007-11

The purpose of this python notebook is to promote the work of the BTO and their contribution to open data science using the BTO atlas.
The BTO atlas was a survey that covered all 10-km squares in the UK and Ireland and in both winter and the breeding season between 2007 and 2011. Fieldwork was completed following the breeding season of 2011, and the data was analysed and published in 2014. Details on the methods and results are available.
